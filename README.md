# Sign-Language-Recognition

Sign language detection is an exciting application of computer vision and machine learning that focuses on recognizing gestures and translating them into written or spoken language. This technology can greatly benefit people who use sign language as a primary means of communication, bridging the gap between them and those unfamiliar with it. In this project, we will develop a system in Python that can detect and classify sign language gestures, allowing for real-time translation.
The main goals of this project are:
Gesture Recognition: Use computer vision to identify hand gestures and movements from video or live webcam feed.
Classification of Signs: Classify recognized gestures into specific letters, words, or actions in a sign language (such as ASL - American Sign Language).
Real-Time Detection: Implement real-time detection and classification to facilitate smooth and fast communication.
Key Components

Data Collection: Collect and preprocess a dataset of hand gestures representing different signs. For example, you can use existing datasets like the ASL Alphabet dataset or custom datasets created from video recordings.

Hand Detection: Use techniques like OpenCV for hand tracking or MediaPipe for hand landmarks to detect and segment hands in an image or video feed.

Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features, such as hand position, angles between fingers, or distances, to represent each gesture accurately. MediaPipe's hand landmark model is beneficial for obtaining 3D hand landmarks directly.

Model Training: Use machine learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sequential data to train the system on gesture recognition. Pre-trained models like MobileNet or ResNet can also be fine-tuned for this purpose.

Real-Time Detection and Translation: Combine the trained model with a video feed to detect gestures in real time. The output can be displayed as text or synthesized speech for ease of communication.

Applications
Assistive Communication: Helps in translating sign language into text or speech.
Accessibility Tools: Facilitates more accessible interfaces for hearing-impaired individuals.
Educational Tools: Can aid in learning and practicing sign language
